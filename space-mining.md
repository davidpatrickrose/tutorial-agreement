# Asteroid Mining Agreement

`Purpose` Depending on your life circumstances, this template is:

- for your next asteroid mining expedition; or
- to show you how CodePact's interface works.

BlueSkyMines is setting up to mine [Asteroid 4 Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta) for the IAU (the International Astronomical Union). 

The first section below identifies the parties (those signing the contract).

`Party 1 Name` BlueSkyMines

`Party 2 Name` IAU

## Payment Calculation

Here at CodePact, we like to put the most important commercial terms of a contract up front. This usually means that _money_ is the first commercial point you need to address.

There are lots of ways to calculate payment for a contract, so we use our **payment calculation** _module_ to present you with a set of choices for how to calculate your payment.

Mining an asteroid is a gigantic, slow, job, so it's not really sensible for a company to be paid by the hour. Usually, for a task this large, you'd want to specify a _work scope_, but that's a bit too annoying for a brief tutorial. So we'll just pretend that we've already specified our fees on our webpage.

Just click the pink tick on the fourth clause option below. Then click the pink "fees url" button, and enter any old url. Then you're done with this section.

## How Payment is Made

Now that you've specified the _amount_ of the payments, you need to specify _when_ and _how_ those amount are paid. We use our **payment methods** module for this.

Since asteroid mining is such a big slow job, you'd usually use a milestones based approach. But for simplicity's sake, let's just have a deposit up front, and the remainder of the money on completion. This can be done easily with the third clause option below.

So, click on the pink tick next to "the IAU will pay a deposit when the Services commence and the rest when the Services are complete", click on the pink buttons that are revealed and fill in some sensible values. Then you're done with this section.

## Limits on claims

Phew! We're finished talking about payments. Now we have to move on to less interesting stuff.

For any commercial agreement, you have to worry about the things that can go wrong. Asteroid mining is a risky job, so you probably want to limit how much the IAU can sue you for if things happen to go wrong. Most lawyers generally call this a limitation of liability. We call it limits on claims. It's a little easier to understand.

Since we're just learning, let's limit the IAU's claims to the legal minimum. Click the pink tick next to the first clause option below, and when you're asked if you want any exceptions to apply click no.

You'll notice that the phrase "limited to the legal minimum" is a link. That's because there's a whole bunch of tedious legalese behind that link. If you want to read it, go ahead, but you don't really need to in order to understand the purpose of the contract.

## Necessary Bureaucracy

Phew! Almost done! Now we just need to specify a bunch of boring legal junk, like who pays taxes and what courts settle any disputes about the contract. Click the pink tick next to "Necessary Bureaucracy", then click on the following pink buttons.

You might be noticing a pattern here. Pink means you've got something to do. Blue means you've already done it.

## Congratulations

If you've missed anything, you'll have a pink "NEXT STEP" button in the sidebar on the left. If there's a "SIGN DOCUMENT" button instead, then congratulations, you just wrote a contract. It may have seemed too easy to be a solid legal document, but the reality is that most people think contracts need to be far more complicated than necessary.

We support digital signing of agreements too, but since you probably entered fake email details in the first clause, you won't be able to do that. But feel free to go back and change that if you want to see how digital signing works.

Feel free to go back and play around with the other options at each step too. It'll give you an idea of the scope and flexibility of our templates. We have a whole bunch of more practical templates available. Stuff like Software development contracts, or privacy policies that comply with Australian privacy law. Please do check them out.
