# Asteroid Mining Agreement

`Purpose` Depending on your life circumstances, this template is:

- for your next asteroid mining expedition; or
- to show you how CodePact's interface works.

BlueSkyMines is arranging to mine [Asteroid 4660 Nereus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4660_Nereus), which is owned by the IAU (the International Astronomical Union). IAU hire contractors to do the grunt work.

The design pattern of this interface is that the color pink means you've got something to do and blue means you've done it.

The first section below identifies the parties (those signing the contract).

`Party 1 Name` BlueSkyMines

`Party 2 Name` IAU

## Payment Calculation

We think it makes sense to put the most important commercial terms of a contract up front.  Order should be determined by commercial priority, not traditional legal order.

For a BlueSkyMines Void Buccaneer, pay's usually top of mind, so let's do that first.

Ways to get paid are set out as options below.  Getting paid by the hour to mine an asteroid is a good option for BlueSkyMines, but IAU is probably going to ask for a flat rate (more risk for BlueSkyMines).

Click the pink tick on the first clause option below. Then click the pink "payment rate" button, and enter your rate.

## How Payment is made

Now that you've specified the hourly rate, you need to specify _when_ and _how_ the amounts are paid. We use our **payment methods** module for this.

Like all mining, asteroid mining is capital intensive, so we'll need to get paid as we go with invoices. This can be done easily with the first clause option below.

Click on the pink tick next to "BlueSkyMines will invoice IAU for the Services while the Services continue", click on the pink buttons that are revealed and fill in terms that are good enough to keep you resupplied during the work.

## Limits on claims

Now we deal with risk.

For any commercial agreement, you have to worry about the things that can go wrong.

IAU owns the asteroid, so you need to be careful when you mine it.  A negligently placed explosive charge can break the asteroid up entirely, which is an expensive day in court for the negligent contractor.

The way to handle this is an agreement to limit claims.  It's always best for a service provider to limit a claim to the legal minimum, so let's give that a whirl.  IAU probably won't accept the ability to only sue for the legal minimum, but we can always step down to the next position along if needs be.

Click the pink tick next to the first clause option below, and when you're asked if you want any exceptions to apply click no.

You'll notice that the phrase "limited to the legal minimum" is a link. That's because there's a whole bunch of tedious legalese behind that link, which is imported into the contract.

This is how we do complex legal jargon: it's still in the contract, it still matters, but it's easier to deal with if we represent it with simpler wording.

## Necessary Bureaucracy

Phew! Almost done! Now we just need to specify a bunch of boring legal junk, like who pays taxes and what courts settle any disputes about the contract. Click the pink tick next to "Necessary Bureaucracy", then click on the following pink buttons.

## Congratulations

If you've missed anything, you'll have a pink "NEXT STEP" button in the sidebar on the left. If there's a "SIGN DOCUMENT" button instead, then congratulations, you just wrote a contract. It may have seemed too easy to be a solid legal document, but the reality is that most people think contracts need to be far more complicated than necessary.

We support digital signing of agreements too, but since you probably entered fake email details in the first clause, you won't be able to do that. But feel free to go back and change that if you want to see how digital signing works.

Feel free to go back and play around with the other options at each step too. It'll give you an idea of the scope and flexibility of our templates. We have a whole bunch of more practical templates available. Stuff like Software development contracts, or privacy policies that comply with Australian privacy law. Please do check them out.
