### Purpose

The open source agreement in this repository introduces users to the CodepPact interface. 

### LawPatch

This agreement uses LawPatch because legalese is tedious.  You can read about LawPatch [here](http://lawpatch.org).

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice.  People who happen to be lawyers are authors of these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances.  Speak to your lawyer to make sure that the agreement is well aligned with your circumstances.

### Licence
